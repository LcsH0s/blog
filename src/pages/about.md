title: About Me
---

I've been coding and making software for the last ten years, and even if us SWEs tend to complain a lot, I just love my job.

To me, coding is a craftsmanship, and following this analogy, I strive on becoming a [master craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman). This blog is a new way for me to share my passion, a mean to [make awsome new friends](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/) with similar interests.

This [open source](https://github.com/LcsH0s/blog) blog is also an excuse for me to fulfill my second passion: teaching. Personally, the way I like to learn is from *someone* instead of *something*, and I think it's time for me to start [producing after consuming so much](https://pcandmore.net/blog/producing-instead-of-consuming/).
